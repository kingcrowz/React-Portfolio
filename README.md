# React-Portfolio
remaking my react portfolio using knowledge and skills learned independently after fullstack development course's conclusion.

During this learning process, I feel the skill that has developed the most is my ability to google a problem, and my ability to understand the docs.

My sense of color matching has always been weak, so if you've got any ideas on new color layouts, I'd love to hear your feedback.

Bulk has been uploaded, after a few weeks of work, will tweak minor parts from here.
